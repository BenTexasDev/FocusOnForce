Apex Tests
-Since data created in tests do not commit, you will note need to 
delete any data.
-Lines of code in test methods and test classes are not counted as part of
calculating Apex code coverage.
-- Code coverage is calculated by dividing the number of unique Apex code
lines executed during test method execution by the total number of Apex code lines
